# Hold and Unhold Commands for Admins

This resource provides `/hold <id>` and `/unhold <id>` commands for server administrators in FiveM. The `/hold` command allows admins to hold a player at a specified location, while the `/unhold` command releases them. These commands are particularly useful for managing players during admin tasks.

## Features

- **Hold a Player**: Use `/hold <id>` to hold a specified player at the position of the admin who issued the command.
- **Release a Player**: Use `/unhold <id>` to release the held player.
- **ACE Permissions**: The commands are secured with ACE permissions to ensure only authorized users can execute them.

## Installation

1. **Download the Resource**: Clone or download this repository to your server's resources folder.

2. **Add to `server.cfg`**:
   Ensure that your resource is started by adding the following line to your `server.cfg`:

Add ACE Permissions: To use the /hold and /unhold commands, you'll need to set up ACE permissions in your server.cfg. Hereâ€™s how to do it:


Copy code

This command gives all users in the admin group permission to use the hold commands. Make sure you replace group.admin with the appropriate group or user you want to grant permissions to.
